 A group of commits can be combined into a single commit using a rebase to clarify the development log.

Make sure to git pull or fetch the latest code before making updates. 
This will help avoid conflicts at merge time.

commit log messages should explain the “why” and “what” that encompass the commits content.


Agree on a Workflow
By default SCMs offer very free form methods of contribution. 
It is important that teams establish shared patterns of collaboration. 
SCM workflows establish patterns and processes for merging branches. 
If a team doesn't agree on a shared workflow it can lead to inefficient 
communication overhead when it comes time to merge branches.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Cloning to a specific folder

git clone <repo> <directory>

Clone the repository located at ＜repo＞ into the folder called ~＜directory＞! on the local machine.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Cloning a specific tag

git clone --branch <tag> <repo>

Clone the repository located at ＜repo＞ and only clone the ref for ＜tag＞.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Shallow clone

git clone -depth=1 <repo>

Clone the repository located at ＜repo＞ and only clone the 
history of commits specified by the option depth=1. In this example 
a clone of ＜repo＞ is made and only the most recent commit is 
included in the new cloned Repo. 

An extensive commit history may cause scaling problems such as 
disk space usage limits and long wait times when cloning.

--------------------------------------------------------------

git clone -branch

git clone -branch new_feature git://remoterepository.git

This above example would clone only the new_feature branch from 
the remote Git repository. This is purely a convince utility 
to save you time from downloading the HEAD ref of the 
repository and then having to additionally fetch the ref you need.

--------------------------------------------------------------

git clone --template

git clone --template=<template_directory> <repo location>

Clones the repo at ＜repo location＞ and applies the template 
from ＜template directory＞ to the newly created local branch.
